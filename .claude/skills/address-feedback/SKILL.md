  "iterate on the PR", "fix review comments", or "merge if Claude approved".
  Locates the most recent Claude LGTM via GitHub MCP, triages comments into a

# Address Feedback

Close the loop on a Claude PR review: find the latest LGTM (or feedback), iterate locally with TDD, push once, and merge only when the LGTM is current and CI is green.

## Prompt-Engineering Tactics (Brief)

Before touching code, restate each review thread as a 6-component micro-prompt so the fix is precise instead of sprawling:

- **Role** — "Engineer addressing a single review comment."
- **Goal** — the exact change requested (one sentence).
- **Context** — `file:line`, the surrounding 5-10 lines, the reviewer's quote.
- **Format** — minimal diff; no drive-by refactors.
- **Examples** — if the reviewer suggested code, paste it verbatim.
- **Constraints** — keep blast radius small; preserve public API; add a regression test.

If a comment is ambiguous on any component, reply asking for clarification rather than guessing. See `prompt-engineering` for the full framework.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Locate the Most Recent Claude LGTM (or Feedback)

Use the GitHub MCP tools — never `gh` CLI. The goal is to determine whether a current LGTM exists for `HEAD`, or what feedback is outstanding.

1. Get the PR's current head SHA:
   - `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: "get"` → record `head.sha`.
2. List all reviews on the PR:
   - `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: "get_reviews"`.
3. Filter to reviews authored by the Claude reviewer (login typically `claude` or `claude[bot]`; if uncertain, also match `body` containing `LGTM` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`).
4. Sort by `submitted_at` descending. The first match is the most recent Claude review.
5. Classify:
   - **Current LGTM** — `state == "APPROVED"` AND `commit_id == head.sha`. Skip to Step 6.
   - **Stale LGTM** — `state == "APPROVED"` but `commit_id != head.sha`. Treat as needing a fresh review after any further changes.
   - **Changes requested / commented** — gather all line comments via `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: "get_review_comments"`, scoped to that review.
   - **No Claude review yet** — request one via `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` with `event: "REQUEST_CHANGES"` style request, then stop and tell the user.

### Step 2: Triage Comments into a Fix Plan

For each unresolved review comment, build a row:

| id | file:line | quote | requested change | test idea | severity |

Apply the prompt-engineering framing above. Drop or push back on comments that are out of scope, factually wrong, or already addressed — reply with a short justification instead of changing code.

### Step 3: Fix Locally with TDD — Never Push to Probe CI

For each row, smallest unit first:

1. **Red** — write a test that fails because of the bug the reviewer flagged.
2. **Green** — make the minimal change; the test passes.
3. **Refactor** — only within the same file, only if it stays green.

Then run the full local gate before any push:

```bash
# Whatever the project uses; pick the equivalents:
pre-commit run --all-files
./scripts/test.sh --all      # or pytest / npm test / go test ./... / cargo test
./scripts/typecheck.sh       # or mypy / tsc --noEmit / etc.
```

If a check fails, fix it locally and re-run. **Do not push to use CI as your test runner.** See `stay-green` for the gates and `ci-debugging` only if a local-green change later fails in CI.

### Step 4: Reply, Resolve, Re-Request

For each comment, after the fix lands locally:

1. `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment` — short reply: what changed, where (`src/x.py:42`), and the commit SHA once pushed.
2. `mcp__github__resolve_review_thread` — only if the change is in and the reply is posted.
3. After all threads are resolved, `mcp__github__pull_request_review_write` with `event: "REQUEST_REVIEW"` (or post a fresh `@claude please re-review` comment via `mcp__github__add_issue_comment`) so the next review is keyed to the new HEAD.

### Step 5: Push Once and Watch CI

Push the branch (single push, not one per comment). Optionally `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity` so review and CI events surface here. If CI fails, switch to `ci-debugging`; otherwise wait for the new Claude review.

### Step 6: Merge Gate — All Must Hold

Merge only when **every** condition is true. If any fails, stop and explain which one.

- Latest Claude review is `APPROVED`.
- That review's `commit_id == head.sha` (the LGTM is for the current HEAD, not a stale one).
- All required status checks are `success` (`mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: "get_status_checks"`).
- No unresolved review threads remain.
- The PR is `mergeable` and not `draft`.

Then:

```
mcp__github__merge_pull_request
  pull_number: <N>
  merge_method: "squash"   # or whatever the repo standard is
```

Confirm the merge succeeded; do not delete the remote branch unless the user asks.

## Examples

### Example 1: Current LGTM, Green CI — Merge

1. `pull_request_read get` → `head.sha = abc123`.
2. `pull_request_read get_reviews` → latest Claude review: `APPROVED`, `commit_id = abc123`.
3. `pull_request_read get_status_checks` → all `success`.
4. No unresolved threads. → `merge_pull_request` with `squash`. Report merge URL.

### Example 2: Stale LGTM After New Commits

1. Latest Claude review: `APPROVED`, `commit_id = def456`, but `head.sha = abc123`. LGTM is stale.
2. State that the LGTM does not cover HEAD, request a fresh review via `pull_request_review_write`, and **do not merge**.

### Example 3: CHANGES_REQUESTED with Three Comments

1. Triage table built from `get_review_comments`. Comment 2 is out of scope — reply explaining why; skip the code change.
2. For comments 1 and 3: Red-Green-Refactor locally, run `pre-commit run --all-files` and the test suite. All green.
3. Single `git push`. Reply on each thread with the change summary and SHA, then `resolve_review_thread`.
4. `pull_request_review_write` requesting re-review. Wait. On next LGTM, re-enter the merge gate (Step 6).

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Cannot tell which review is "Claude's"

Match by login (`claude`, `claude[bot]`) first. If that fails, match by `user.type == "Bot"` plus `body` containing `LGTM` / `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. If still ambiguous, ask the user which reviewer to treat as authoritative — do not guess.

### Error: LGTM exists but `commit_id` differs from HEAD

The LGTM is stale. Any commit, even a docs-only one, invalidates it for merge purposes. Request a fresh review and re-enter Step 6 only after the new approval lands on the current HEAD.

### Error: Reviewer's suggestion would break tests or public API

Do not silently ignore. Reply on the thread with the conflict (failing test name, API consumer, or constraint), propose an alternative, and pause until the user or reviewer agrees. Never bypass with `--no-verify` or skip checks; see `max-quality-no-shortcuts`.

### Error: Tempted to push to "see what CI says"

Stop. Reproduce the check locally first (`pre-commit run --all-files`, full test suite, typecheck). Pushing speculatively burns minutes per round trip and trains a sloppy loop. Only push when local gates are green.

### Error: Merge gate passes but `mergeable` is `false`

Conflicts with the base branch. Rebase or merge `main` locally, resolve, re-run local gates, push. The new commit invalidates the LGTM — request a fresh review before re-entering the merge gate.
