  Push well-worn-tools skills outward to every sibling GitHub repo owned

  to other repos", "share well-worn-tools across my projects", "open PRs
  adding skills to <repo>", or "propagate my skills". Honors
  metadata.distribute false in each skill's frontmatter to skip exempt
  skills (collect-skills, distribute-skills, and any other opted out).
  Computes the missing-skill set per target, creates a feature branch
  with the new entries, commits with provenance, and opens a PR via
  Python helpers in scripts/. The agent reviews each per-repo plan before
  any push. This skill itself is exempt (metadata.distribute false). Do
  NOT use for ingesting skills FROM other repos (use collect-skills
  skill), authoring new skills (use skill-craft skill), or routine PR
  review or feedback iteration (use comprehensive-pr-review or
  address-feedback skills).

# Distribute Skills

Propagate well-worn-tools skills to sibling GitHub repos by opening one PR per target with whatever skills that repo is missing. Run from inside the well-worn-tools checkout.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+.
- Working tree clean — the skill never reads from uncommitted local changes.
- For the local path: `gh` CLI authenticated, plus `git` configured to push to the owner's repos.
- For the cloud path: GitHub MCP server tools (`mcp__github__*`) with write access to each target repo.

## Execution Environment

The Python helpers shell out to `gh` and `git push`. Pick the path before doing anything:

```bash
if [ "${CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE:-}" = "true" ] || ! command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "cloud path — see 'MCP-Only Flow' at the bottom"
else
  echo "local path — Python helpers below"
fi
```

| Environment | Path |
|-------------|------|
| Claude Code CLI (terminal) | local — Python helpers, `gh` + `git push` work |
| Claude Code desktop (Mac / Windows) | local — same |
| Claude Code on the web (claude.ai/code) | cloud — MCP-only flow |
| Claude Code on iOS / mobile | cloud — same as web |

Both paths produce identical PRs. `discover.py local` is pure Python and works in either path — the exemption logic does not depend on `gh`.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine the GitHub Owner

```bash
python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/discover.py owner
```

### Step 2: List Distributable Local Skills

```bash
python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/discover.py local
```

Walks `.claude/skills/`, parses each frontmatter, and excludes any with `metadata.distribute: false`. By design, this skill and `collect-skills` are exempt and never appear in the output. See `references/exemption-rules.md` for the full exemption logic.

### Step 3: List Target Repos

```bash
python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/discover.py targets <owner>
```

Returns non-archived, non-fork repos. The current repo (well-worn-tools) is excluded as a target.

### Step 4: Compute the Missing Set per Target

```bash
python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/check_target.py <owner>/<repo>
```

For the given target, prints the skill names that exist locally (and are distributable) but are absent in the target's `.claude/skills/`. Empty output means the target is fully up to date.

### Step 5: Build the Per-Repo Plan

For each target with a non-empty missing set, draft the plan:

- Target repo and default branch
- List of skills to add
- Branch name (default: `add-well-worn-skills/<YYYY-MM-DD>`)
- PR title and body (the Python helper produces a draft body — review it)

Show the plan to the user before any push. If the user wants to scope down (e.g., add only one skill to one repo), update the manifest accordingly.

### Step 6: Distribute (with Confirmation)

```bash
python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/distribute.py \
    <owner>/<repo> \
    --skills <skill-1> <skill-2> ... \
    --branch add-well-worn-skills/$(date +%F) \
    [--dry-run]
```

The script:

1. Clones the target repo into a temporary directory at the default branch.
2. Creates the feature branch.
3. Copies each requested skill from this checkout into `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` of the clone, refusing to overwrite if the target already has a directory by that name.
4. Commits with a message that names the source SHA in well-worn-tools.
5. Pushes the branch.
6. Opens a PR via `gh pr create` with a body that lists each skill, its purpose (from frontmatter description), and a link back to well-worn-tools.

`--dry-run` does steps 1-4 without pushing or opening the PR. Use it on the first target as a sanity check.

### Step 7: Verify the PR Looks Right

After distribute completes for a target, open the PR URL it printed and confirm:

- The branch contains only the intended skill directories
- The PR body lists each skill correctly
- No accidentally bundled changes to other files

If anything is off, close the PR and delete the branch before proceeding to the next target.

### Step 8: Iterate Across Targets

Repeat Steps 4-7 for each target. Do not parallelize without supervision — one PR-storm with bad metadata is worse than ten thoughtful PRs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Distribute One New Skill to All Targets

After importing `cve-remediation`, propagate it everywhere:

```bash
$ python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/discover.py targets Geoffe-Ga
Geoffe-Ga/another-tool
Geoffe-Ga/some-service
$ for target in Geoffe-Ga/another-tool Geoffe-Ga/some-service; do
    missing=$(python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/check_target.py "$target")
    if echo "$missing" | grep -q '^cve-remediation$'; then
      python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/distribute.py \
          "$target" --skills cve-remediation --dry-run
    fi
  done
$ # Review dry-run output, then re-run without --dry-run for each target.
```

### Example 2: Bring a Single Cold Repo Up to Date

```bash
$ python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/check_target.py Geoffe-Ga/some-service
ci-debugging
cve-remediation
security
stay-green
testing
$ python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/distribute.py \
      Geoffe-Ga/some-service \
      --skills ci-debugging cve-remediation security stay-green testing \
      --branch bootstrap-well-worn-skills
```

One PR introducing five skills is fine if the target is empty. Split across PRs if a single PR would obscure review.

### Example 3: Refuse to Overwrite

```bash
$ python .claude/skills/distribute-skills/scripts/distribute.py \
      Geoffe-Ga/some-service --skills security --dry-run
ERROR: target already has .claude/skills/security/ — refuse to overwrite.
Hint: use collect-skills to compare versions, or pick a different skill.
```

If the target has its own version of a skill, the right path is `collect-skills` (pull theirs in, diff, decide), not blind overwrite.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: gh CLI not authenticated
Run `gh auth login` and re-run. Pushing branches and opening PRs both need an authenticated session.

### Error: Target already has the skill
Distribute refuses to overwrite. Use `collect-skills` to ingest the target's version, diff, decide, and only then propagate the agreed-on canonical version. Distribute is for additive PRs only.

### Error: Skill marked distributable that should be exempt
Add `metadata.distribute: false` to the skill's frontmatter. The exemption is per-skill in source, not a separate config file, so it travels with the skill if it's ever moved.

### Error: PR body is too generic
The default body lists each skill's name and description. Edit the PR after creation if the target audience needs more context — but improving the source skill's description usually helps every future PR.

### Error: A target needs additional setup files (e.g. CI hooks)
Distribute deliberately ships only `.claude/skills/<name>/`. If the skills depend on a missing harness, add a checklist to the PR body so the target maintainer knows. Do not silently bundle unrelated config.

## MCP-Only Flow (Cloud Environments)

When `gh` and local `git push` are unavailable, drive the same workflow through GitHub MCP tools. The agent does the orchestration; no clone is needed because `mcp__github__push_files` writes directly to a remote branch in one commit.

| Step | Local helper | MCP equivalent |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1. Owner | `discover.py owner` | Read `git remote get-url origin` via Bash; parse owner. (No GitHub call needed.) |
| 2. Local skills | `discover.py local` | Same — pure Python, no `gh`. |
| 3. Targets | `discover.py targets <owner>` | `mcp__github__search_repositories` with query `user:<owner>` (or `org:<owner>`); filter archived, forks, and well-worn-tools in the agent. |
| 4. Diff target | `check_target.py <owner>/<repo>` | `mcp__github__get_file_contents` on the target's `.claude/skills` path; intersect with the local list to compute missing names. |
| 5. Plan | (agent builds in-context) | Same — pure context work. |
| 6. Distribute | `distribute.py ... [--dry-run]` | (a) `mcp__github__create_branch` on the target. (b) Read each local skill's files with the `Read` tool. (c) `mcp__github__push_files` once per target with all files for all selected skills, including a commit message that names the source SHA. (d) `mcp__github__create_pull_request` with title and body. |
| 7. Verify | Open PR URL | Same — open the URL the MCP call returns. |

The `--dry-run` semantics in cloud are: stop after step (b), report the file list and intended commit/PR text, and do not call `create_branch` or `push_files`. Implement this in the agent's plan, not in code.

`push_files` refuses to overwrite if the path already exists in the target. That preserves the same overwrite-refusal contract `distribute.py` enforces — if a target already has the skill, fall back to `collect-skills`.
